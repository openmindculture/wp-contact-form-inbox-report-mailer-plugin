== Description ==

Contact Form Inbox Report Mailer sends email reports of Flamingo contact form inbox entries, including possible spam. The Flamingo plugin is required! Contact Form 7 and Aksimet are assumed. By default, an email will be sent to the default admin email adress every day, containing an inbox overview of the last 48 hours in HTML format. More configuration options will be added in upcoming releases. Do not rely on interval times on pages with low traffic, as WordPress task schedule relies on regular page visits! After changing schedule settings, (re)activate the plugin to (re)schedule if necessary. This plugin is free software, provided as-is with absolutely no warranty! Feel free to contribute on GitHub to report problems and add missing features!
